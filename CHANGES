v1.2
----

OpenBSD support by "Alexander S . Guy" <a7r@andern.org>. Thanks!

Hopefully now that Python 1.6 has been released, distutils will
start to be used. I haven't tested this version under 1.6 yet,
but I assume it will still work.

v1.1
----

Fixes for odd cases under recent-ish Linux kernels, whereby the cdrom
driver wants programs to open the device in mode O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK
if they're reading audio tracks.

Fix for when running DiscID.py from command line, was passing in
name of device rather than opened device previously (how embarassing!)

v1.0
----

First full 1.0 release. Fixed several bugs related to multiple
match returns from CDDB in CDDB.py and cddb-info.py.

cdrom module now supports FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and Win32.

Provide setup.py for when distutils starts being used.

v0.5
----

Initial release. Most functionality is there. cdrom module only
provided for Linux.
