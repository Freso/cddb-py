v1.4
----

Updated FreeDB version field to 5; this allows us to get access to the
DYEAR and DGENRE fields in disc info from CDDB.read().

Added Mac OS X support to cdrommodule.c; thanks to Andre Beckedorf
and Jeffrey C. Jacobs.

Changed default Solaris CD-ROM device to /dev/vol/aliases/cdrom0.

v1.3
----

Phew. Lots of updating.

Default to freedb.freedb.org for the CDDB server; I don't want to play
GraceNote's licensing games.  FreeDB is great and works perfectly.

New cdrom.open() and wrapper DiscID.open() calls to perform
"do what I mean" CD audio device opening appropriate to each
platform; even works on Win32.

Update win32/mci.dll for Python 2.0; thanks to Mike Roberts
<zoarre@yahoo.com> for the recompile!  Also, remove all occurences of
'import fcntl', as it's no longer necessary with the new DiscID.open()
call.  Tested and works on Windows 2000 with Python 2.0.

Update cddb-info.py to reflect the new simple DiscID.open() call.

Update setup.py to use the new Extension module instead of the
old way for specifying which C files to compile.

Update win32/cdrom.py to add a cdrom.open() call.  Since win32 does
not use an open file for the audio cdrom, just returns the "device"
string passed in. The default of cdaudio should be fine for most
people, but I assume there are alternate "device" names.

Update unix/cdrommodule.c to add a cdrom.open() call.  Uses #define'd
defaults appropriate to each platform for both the CDROM device file
name (/dev/cdrom on bsd/linux, /dev/vol/alias/cdrom0 on Solaris) and
the flags to use (O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK on Linux).

Add setup-win.py, experimental win32 setup.py.  Untested.

v1.2
----

OpenBSD support by "Alexander S . Guy" <a7r@andern.org>. Thanks!

Hopefully now that Python 1.6 has been released, distutils will
start to be used. I haven't tested this version under 1.6 yet,
but I assume it will still work.

v1.1
----

Fixes for odd cases under recent-ish Linux kernels, whereby the cdrom
driver wants programs to open the device in mode O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK
if they're reading audio tracks.

Fix for when running DiscID.py from command line, was passing in
name of device rather than opened device previously (how embarassing!)

v1.0
----

First full 1.0 release. Fixed several bugs related to multiple
match returns from CDDB in CDDB.py and cddb-info.py.

cdrom module now supports FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and Win32.

Provide setup.py for when distutils starts being used.

v0.5
----

Initial release. Most functionality is there. cdrom module only
provided for Linux.
